# ZSH Themes

## How to get ZSH Themes
You will want to go to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)'s README file and follow their instructions based on your operating system. ZSH is used by Linux/Darwin/MacOS primarily, so you might have some special instructions if you are using windows.

## Minimalist Arrow Theme

This is a very minimalist curved arrow ZSH theme. It doesn't have any git support, but that is because I wanted this theme to be as *minimalist* as possible.
